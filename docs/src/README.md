# Deployer

This repo provides tools for deploying Juicebox projects with suckers.

## Install

For `npm` projects (recommended):

```bash
npm install @bananapus/721-hook
```

For `forge` projects (not recommended):

```bash
forge install Bananapus/nana-721-hook
```

Add `@bananapus/721-hook/=lib/nana-721-hook/` to `remappings.txt`. You'll also need to install `nana-721-hook`'s dependencies and add similar remappings for them.

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
```

You can download and install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install && forge install
```

If you run into trouble with `forge install`, try using `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that nested submodules have been properly initialized.
